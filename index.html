    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Advances in deep learning are enabling reinforcement learning (RL) agents
      to accomplish increasingly difficult tasks. For instance, relatively
      simple machine learning agents can learn how to beat humans in video
      games, without ever having been programmed how to do so. However, agents
      sometimes learn to make correct decisions for the wrong reasons, which can
      lead to surprising and perplexing failures later. In order to diagnose
      such problems effectively, the developer needs to understand how
      information flows through the artificial neural network that powers the
      agent's decision-making process.
    </p>
    <p>
      One approach to visualizing how complex models operate on image inputs is
      through saliency maps. A saliency map is a heatmap highlighting those
      pixels of the input image that are most responsible for the model output.
      An example could be a neural network performing an image classification
      task: given a photograph of a dog in a meadow that was correctly classfied
      as "dog", a saliency map highlights the pixels the network considers most
      dog-like. This lets us check whether the network has truly learned the
      concept of dogs, or whether it merely made a lucky guess based on the
      presence of the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some extent, the methods for generating saliency maps can be repurposed
      for the analysis of RL agents playing video games, since the agent infers
      actions (labels) from render frames (images). However, the resulting
      heatmaps are often blurry or noisy. Furthermore, image classifiers simply
      detect individual objects, while RL agents must choose actions based on complex
      relationships between entities detected in the input. A simple heatmap
      visualization cannot convey whether and where such relationships were
      detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this work, we present a potential improvement to existing visualization
      approaches in RL, and report on our experimental findings regarding their
      performance on six Atari games.
    </p>
    <h2 id="attention-in-rl-agents">Attention in RL agents</h2>
    <p>
      In 2018, Yang et al.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> explored
      the effects of adding two <em>attention layers</em> to the decision-making
      network of an agent learning to play Breakout and other games. The
      attention layers, applied after some convolutional layers which detect
      basic game entities, restrict the input to the agent's action selection
      mechanism to a subset of the input pixels (the <em>attention mask</em>).
      In effect, this bottleneck forces the agent's model to focus spatially.
      This can improve sample efficiency, but more importantly, the
      attention layer activations provide a direct clue about what the model is
      focusing on. This directness is attractive when compared to
      <em>post-hoc</em> methods, which require additional computation to reason
      about the relevance of network activations after inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that there is no direct correspondence between activated attention
      layer neurons and relevant input pixels. This is due to the convolutional
      downsampling layers that separate the input image from the attention
      layers. However, we can generate a heatmap by backpropagating the
      attention tensor through the network. Several different approaches exist
      to accomplish this, from the gradient method introduced by Simonyan et
      al.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> to the more recent
      SmoothGrad<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> and VarGrad<sup
        id="fnref6"
        ><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup
      >
      sampling methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some experimentation, Yang et al. chose a simpler approach, where
      they simply visualized the receptive field of the neuron which
      corresponded to the single strongest activation in their agent's attention layer.
      Their findings confirm that in trained agents, the attention tends to be
      strong near crucial entities in the game, i.e. the Pacman sprite or the
      moving ball in Breakout. However, their attention mask heatmaps are fairly
      crude.
    </p>
    <h2 id="adding-regularization-to-sharpen-the-attention-masks">
      Sharper attention masks through entropy regularization
    </h2>
    <p>
      The effectiveness of attention layers depends crucially on how the
      attention is constrained. This is especially true in architectures with
      repeated downsampling, such as Yang et al.'s, where a small but diffuse attention mask will effectively
      correspond to all input pixels, defeating the purpose of the attention layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      To incentivize more informative heatmaps than those obtained by Yang et
      al., we therefore added an extra loss term to represent the diffuseness of the
      attention tensor. Several options for such loss terms exist; we settled on using the
      entropy of the final attention layer.
    </p>
    <figure>
          <img
            src="images/architecture.png"
            class="center"
            alt="Diagram of the architecture used in our models."
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 1: The architecture of Yang et al., which we used in all
            experiments. The place where we applied entropy loss is highlighted.
            Diagram adapted from Yang et al.
          </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The entropy of the attention mask is a single number that captures whether
      the attention is spread diffusely across the layer (high entropy) or
      concentrated in a few locations (low entropy). For our purposes, a
      high entropy is undesirable, as we wish to constrain attention to only a
      few locations. In other words, the extra loss term rewards our agent for
      focusing on only a few locations of the input image, which we can later visualize.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a discrete probability distribution \(p_i, i=1..n\), entropy is defined
      as:
    </p>
    <p>
      \[ \operatorname{entropy}(p) = -\sum_{i = 1}^n p_i \cdot \log(p_i). \]
    </p>
    <p>
      This quantity is greatest when \(p_i \equiv \frac 1 n\) for all \(i\),
      i.e., when the probability distribution is perfectly
      uniform. By contrast, it is equal to zero when \(p_i = 1\) for some \(i\),
      while the other outcomes have zero probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our case, we regard the output of the attention layer as a probability
      distribution, and we modify the loss in such way as to minimize the
      entropy of this distribution. Specifically, we add \(\lambda \cdot
      \operatorname{entropy}(attn)\) to the loss, where \(\lambda\) is a
      non-negative coefficient and \(attn\) is the output of the attention
      layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although attention mechanisms have been shown to improve training times,
      excessively strong regularization will naturally prevent the agent from
      taking into account complex relationships between spatially distant
      entities, and thus degrade performance. We ran a suite of experiments to
      quantify the impact of entropy regularization on the agent's performance
      at playing Atari games.
    </p>
    <h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental Results</h2>
    <p>
      We recreated the agent by Yang et al. in TensorFlow using the
      <code>stable-baselines</code
      ><sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> package, a fork of OpenAI's
      <code>baselines</code> package with a stable programming interface and
      improved documentation. Since <code>stable-baselines</code> does not
      include a full implementation of the Rainbow algorithm, we used PPO<sup
        id="fnref4"
        ><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup
      >
      as another state-of-the-art algorithm available in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our experiments show that entropy regularization can be added in such way
      that its effects on attention maps become pronounced, but performance does
      not suffer noticeably. The following figure shows average reward agents
      obtain during training with varying \(\lambda\). The value \(\lambda =
      0.0\) means that entropy loss did not affect training. This setup should
      be regarded as baseline.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/reward_curves.png"
        alt="Average reward during training"
        class="center"
      />
      <figcaption>Figure 2: Average reward during training; higher values are
      better. The purple lines for \(\lambda = 0.0\) correspond to
      unconstrainted attention. In most environments, slightly constraining
      attention does not impair training; in a few (like BeamRider and Seaquest)
      it even leads to *faster* training times.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      These results are reassuring: in the environments tested, constraining
      attention with \(\lambda = 0.0005\) does not slow down training,
      suggesting that we can use entropy regularization to improve our salience visualizations without
      degrading agent performance. The following figure shows how \(\lambda\)
      affects the average performance of trained agents:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/scatterplots.png"
        alt="Figure 3: Scatterplot of final performance. X-axis: attention entropy. Y-axis: average reward."
        class="center"
      />
      <figcaption>
        Figure 3: Scatterplot of final performance. Higher reward and lower
        attention entropy are better. Solid circles denote individual runs with
        various random seeds; cross marks denote averages across runs. Again,
        purple crosses should be considered baseline; note how even small values
        for \(\lambda\) consistently reduce entropy without dramatic effects on performance.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      With the exception for BeamRider, it is clear that for the particular case
      of these Atari games, it is possible to choose a value of \(\lambda\) such
      that the extra term in the loss will have a noticeable effect on entropy
      value, without degrading performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In BeamRider, none of the agents achieved good performance. This is
      expected; the authors of PPO report that learning in BeamRider only starts after roughly 10M
      frames, and we terminated training after exactly 10M frames.

      Entropy regularization ensures that attention masks have a few prominent
      peaks. Each peak corresponds directly to a particular
      configuration of features in the underlying convolutional layers. In the
      entropy-regularized networks, the representation of such feature
      correlations is often pleasantly sparse, lending itself well to a new
      variant of visualization via layer-relevance propagation.

    <p>
      Instead of creating a two-dimensional heatmap based on the activation
      of the entire attention layer, as is commonly done, we chose to focus on only one
      or a few of the newly-obtained attention peaks. We then recurse through
      the layers below, picking the strongest associated activations each time,
      creating a tree structure that represents, at each convolutional layer,
      the features that contributed most to the attention peaks‚Äîand, thus, to
      the agent's chosen action.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tree of features can help us understand not only <em>where</em> the
      most relevant pixels are, but also <em>how</em> these pixels combine to
      form the features that contributed to the action. The following
      interactive display shows a selection of four deep branches of the tree
      structure, and the location of the corresponding features, for a single
      frame of the Breakout environment.

        </div>
    </div>
    <p> 
      We select the peaks of the attention layer using a simple peak detection
      algorithm (more sophisticated approaches, such as k-means clustering with
      a gap-statistic, proved too slow for interactive visualizations).
    </p>
    <p>
      Although such visualizations are quite time-consuming to implement in an
      interactive manner, that effort may be justified. After all, understanding
      an RL agent's behaviour can be more difficult than confirming that a
      simple image classifier correctly detected the relevant features.
    </p>
    <p>
      In comparison, two-dimensional, heatmap-based salience visualizations
      cannot adequately capture the spatial relationships between entities
      in the input that are so essential to selecting the correct action.
      To illustrate this point, we show here the Simonyan gradient, SmoothGrad and VarGrad of the
      input with respect to the (unregularized) attention layer:

      and VarGrad.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <p>
      Although SmoothGrad and VarGrad provide a sharper salience map, this
      advantage quickly diminishes when more samples are used, suggesting that
      much of the apparent structure is due to the noise in the sampling.

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Applying entropy loss to an attention layer in RL agents can help make their
      policy networks more interpretable by creating better opportunities for
      deep, layer-based visualizations with sparse, meaningful peaks, rather
      than the diffuse, population-encoded activity often seen in unregularized
      attention layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have shown that such entropy-based regularization rarely has a negative
      effect on agent performance, and can sometimes even improve it, in a
      variety of Atari environments.
